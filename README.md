# Pascal-HTML5-Canvas
Pascal implementation of a HTML 5 Canvas

In HTML5 the canvas element offers a low level, procedural model that updates a bitmap without using a built-in scene graph. Although being quite low level it simplifies the way to create good looking 2D graphics on the fly.

For Delphi (VCL) a similar element remains missing or is (in case of TCanvas) quite old.

If you want to use your knowledge from HTM5 canvases or want to slowly migrate your Delphi app to HTML5 this library is perfect to get a glimpse of how the canvas element works.
